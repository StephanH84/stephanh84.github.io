    <h2>Work Projects:</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>I worked on webshop product recommendation (at Picalike) using convolutional neural networks (Computer Vision) and some matching algorithm.</li>
            <li>I had a side project on algorithmic trading implementing a Deep Reinforcement Learning paper. The Github <a href="https://github.com/StephanH84/reinforcement_learning_explorations.git" target=”_blank”>repository</a>.</li>
            <li>As a Data Scientist (at Oaktree Technologies) I designed a prototype of an algorithm for the multi-objective optimization of production planning of glasses.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I evaluated new algorithm of eye measurement, for example with SLAM in C++.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Research Projects:</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I also co-run an Aging Research study group (called "Hacking Ageing") with a Discord server for daily discussions.
            </li>
            <li>
                I am part of a Longevity Economy think tank, where our first project at Zelar City was to create a <a href="https://aging.fyi/" target=”_blank”>landing page</a> to direct people new to the aging field to the right places. Beside this we want to create a website with a calculator for estimating the economic value of specific life extension.
            </li>
            <li>
                I have my own <a href="https://aicollaborative.eu/" target=”_blank”>"Accelerating Innovation Research Collaborative"</a> where the idea is to accelerate science and research with methods from AI and other fields.

<section id="bio">
    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>Introduce yourself with a short bio, your background, and key areas of expertise.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a Masters (Diploma) in Pure Mathematics, worked as a Software Engineer for a couple of years and later became a Machine Learning Engineer. Recently for 3 years I worked as a Data Scientist with projects in Operations Research and Computer Vision.

<section id="freelance">
    <h2>Freelance Work</h2>
    <p>Highlight your services in Data Science and your role as a Strategic Innovation Analyst, including any relevant skills or experience.</p>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I am open to projects in Data Science, from optimization, prediction or ranking. But I can quickly learn new applications with my math and programming background.
        </li>
        <li>
            I am also open to projects as Strategic Innovation Analyst, where I bring my upstream analytical strategic thinking to new challenges.
